|player.rb       |`You can find here everything regarding the enemies stats etc...`            |
|app.rb          |`V1 du jeu, your basic fight between José and Josiane (those bastards`            |
|app2.rb         |`You too, hate José and Josiane ? Cool, now you can fight them in this second version of the game. Honestly, it's almost impossible to lose, seriously.  `|
|app3.rb | `As you may see, the file is empty. My brain was half fried when I finished V2`|

**Note** : There's currently one tiny little bug : You, has a player, can go above the restricted 100hp maximum if you use a health pack. Nothing too serious, and hey, this will make the battle against José and Josiane even easier :) 
**Edit** : The bug has been corrected
